# What is capturing content?
Capturing content is when you use this browser extension to capture and preserve content found on the web or
imported through LIA's file upload functionality

# Types of Captures

LIA has 3 ways to capture content. 

### Passive Capturing 
Passive capture works best for web pages that do not indefinitely scroll. The page is captured when you hit the 
bottom of the page. 

### Active Capturing 
Most content can be captured using LIA's active capture technology. Active capture allows you to capture the
entire web page, for non-infinite scrolling page and you can hover over a some videos and most images and capture
them directly

### Upload Capture
Sometimes your captures may come from downloaded files or provided through other means. This option allows you
to upload any type of file into LIA. 

## Known Limitations
Not all content can be captured due to anti-scraping technology. Some of this functionality can be subverted using
other off the shelf solutions available in the chrome store for free or for a fee.
