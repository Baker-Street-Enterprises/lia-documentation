## Welcome to the Local Internet Archive (LIA) Documentation

LIA is an online capture tool for creating a localized version of the Internet. A flexible architecture allows for end users to customize the output of the capture or forward its contents on to enrich the data even more so.
LIA helps make your online work easier by being your own personal private or sharable Internet Search Engine.

LIA can be integrated with 3rd party providers through json schemas.
